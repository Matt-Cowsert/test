## Requester Information

### Problem Statement
Describe the problem, issue, or opportunity this feature addresses. What is FOCUS unable to do today that creates this problem? Include practitioner quotes or real-world examples if available.

```
Write your problem statement here.
```

---

### Use Case / User Story
Provide a clear, specific use case that defines what is being provided to the practitioner or persona:

**As a** [specific role - e.g., FinOps Practitioner, Data Engineer, Procurement/Finance, Tooling Vendor]
**I need to** [specific capability in FOCUS data]
**So that** [measurable outcome or decision I can make]

**Example:**
> As a FinOps practitioner, I need to group costs by resource groupings within my Sub Account, so that I can align cost reporting with my organization's structure without post-processing.

```
Write your use case here.
```

---

### Success Criteria
What needs to be true when we deliver this capability for it to be meaningful? Describe 2-4 specific criteria. Focus on what you need to be able to DO with the data, not implementation details.

**Example** *(describe what you can DO, not structural changes like "add column X"):*
- I can perform cost allocation using this data without additional processing
- The data is consistently available across all data generators that support this concept
- Missing or unavailable data is handled in a clear, standardized way

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
- [ ] Criterion 4

---

### Type of Request
**Select the option that best describes this request.** Maintainers may reclassify during triage.

- [ ] **Standardization** - Data is already available but dispersed across providers
- [ ] **Enhancement** - Refinement or extension of an existing concept or capability
- [ ] **Net New** - Breaking new ground (e.g., net new datasets or capabilities)
- [ ] **Enablement/Supporting Content** - Non-normative items like appendix explanations, examples, or supporting documentation
- [ ] **Tech Debt** - Addressing technical debt or maintenance items *(Note: For Tech Debt items, feel free to liberally delete sections of this template that aren't relevant)*

---

### Organizations Requesting This Feature
List one or more organizations who have requested or explicitly supported this request. For each organization, indicate whether this feature blocks their adoption of FOCUS or is a nice-to-have enhancement.

**Format:**
- **[Organization Name]** - [Adoption Blocker / Nice to Have] - [Brief explanation]

**Example:**
- **Acme Corp** - Adoption Blocker - Cannot implement FOCUS without multi-cloud tagging support
- **BigCloud Inc** - Nice to Have - Would streamline our reporting process

```
List organizations here.
```

---

### Data Generator Support (Optional)
Do data generators already support this concept in their native billing data? It's OK to select "Unknown." Maintainers will validate during triage.

- [ ] **Yes** - Widely available across data generators
- [ ] **Partially** - Some data generators support this, others don't
- [ ] **No** - Would require new data collection/exposure
- [ ] **Unknown** - Not sure about data generator support

**If yes or partially, please provide links to documentation:**

```
Links to data generator documentation.
```

---

### Supporting Documentation (Optional)
Include links to data samples, relevant PRs, GitHub discussions, or implementation references.

> **Reminder:** Please ensure any linked documents are accessible to maintainers and collaborators. If access is restricted, your request may be delayed.

```
Paste links here.
```

---

### Proposed Solution / Approach (Optional)
Share initial ideas, constraints, and feasibility considerations if you have them. Solutions are welcome but not required. Maintainers may explore alternative approaches during discovery.

```
Your proposal goes here.
```

---

### Additional Context (Optional)
Add any other context that might be helpful:

**Current Workaround:**
```
What do you do today without this feature? Is this a heavy workaround or a slight inconvenience?
```

**Urgency/Timeline:**
```
Is there a specific timeframe when your organization needs this?
```

**Related Requests:**
```
Links to similar or related feature requests or scopes of work.
